First install the following.  They all have automated installers on Windows so
are easy to install.

- java runtime environment (JRE)
  http://java.sun.com 
  (Don't need larger java development environment.)

- postgresql
  http://www.postgresql.org
  *** Note that certain antivirus programs conflict with PostgreSQL. ***

- postgresql JDBC driver.  You will be asked if you want to install extra
  software (known as a stack) when you install postgresql.  Be sure to indicate
  you do want the stack and then be sure to tell it that you want to install
  JDBC when asked.

After installing RpgSQL you must ensure that it can find the JDBC .jar file.
This is the only file it needs to know the whereabouts of.  It will search
the following locations for postgres*.jdbc4.jar so ensure that its in one of 
the following places (in the case of RpgSQL.JAR or RpgQL_JAR specify the
exact path and filename of the jar whereas in the others just specify the
path and it will look for a jar whose name is of the form: postgres*.jdbc4.jar
along that path or paths).

  - the path/filename defined by the global R option RpgSQL.JAR
  - the path/filename defined by the environment variable RpgSQL_JAR
  - the current directory
  - the paths defined by the CLASSPATH system environment variable if it exists
  - the system path 
  - /usr/local/pgsql/share/java (non-Windows only)
  - %PROGRAMFILES%\PostgreSQL\pgJDBC (Windows only)

Of course if its already in one of those locations then there is nothing to do.

For example, if the JDBC driver jar file for PostgreSQL is in your home
directory, you could put this into your ~/.Rprofile file (or
%userprofile%\Documents\.Rprofile file on Windows): 

	options(RpgSQL.JAR = "~\\postgresql-8.4-701.jdbc4.jar")

Also the default user, password and dbname are "postgresql", "" and "test". To
specify anything add to the same file these lines:

	options(RpgSQL.user = "myname")
	options(RpgSQL.password = "mypassword")
	options(RpgSQL.dbname = "mydbname")

(That is there are up to 4 lines in all to add to your .Rprofile file.)
